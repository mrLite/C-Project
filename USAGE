USAGE
The program is compiled using the make tool from the command line.
Command 'make' creates an executable AVG_TEMP, which is then run with the settings file as a command line parameter.

The setting file should be of format:

width 1000.0
height 2000.0
grid_size 1.0
temp_left 1000
temp_right 1000
temp_bottom 1000
temp_top 0

Where width and height denotes the object size in centimeters, and grid_size is the edge size of a grid cell in centimeters.
Temperatures are in kelvins and can be omitted, in which case they are initialized to zero.
The setting file can include comments, which are lines starting with symbol '#'.
